Test Plan:->
------------
A test plan is a document outlining the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for 
testing a software application or system. It typically includes:

-> Overview of the system being tested and the purpose of the test plan.
-> Details what will and will not be covered in the testing process.
-> Clear statements of what the testing aims to achieve.
-> Describes the testing methodologies, techniques, and tools that will be used.
-> Lists the documents, reports, and artifacts that will be produced during testing.
-> Timeline for different testing activities, including milestones and deadlines.
-> Specifies the personnel, hardware, software, and other resources required for testing.
-> Identifies potential risks to the testing process and outlines mitigation strategies.
-> Defines the conditions that must be met for testing to be considered complete.
-> Sign-off section for stakeholders to approve the test plan.

How to Create Test Plan:->
--------------------------
-> Gather and review the system requirements to understand what needs to be tested.
-> Define clear and measurable objectives for the testing process.
-> Determine the boundaries of testing, including what functionalities will be tested and any constraints.
-> Choose appropriate testing methodologies, techniques, and tools based on the nature of the system and its requirements.
-> Create detailed test cases that cover various scenarios and conditions.
-> Allocate the necessary resources, including personnel, hardware, software, and testing environments.
-> Create a timeline for different testing phases, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
-> Identify potential risks to the testing process and develop contingency plans to mitigate them.
-> Compile all the above information into a formal document following a standard template or format.
-> Review the test plan with stakeholders, incorporate feedback, and obtain approval before proceeding with testing.

Template for Test Plan:->
-------------------------

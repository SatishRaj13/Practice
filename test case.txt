Test Case:->
------------
A test case is a detailed set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine
whether a system, application, or specific feature is working correctly or not. It typically
consists of input data, execution conditions, expected results, and sometimes even post-execution
criteria.
A unique identifier for the test case.
A brief description of what the test case is intended to test.
Any necessary conditions that must be fulfilled before the test case can be executed.
The specific data or parameters that are provided to the system under test.
A step-by-step procedure for executing the test case.
The anticipated outcome or behavior of the system when the test case is executed correctly.
Any conditions that should be met after the test case has been executed.

Uses of test Case:->
--------------------
Verification: Test cases are used to verify that the software meets its specified requirements. 
              Each test case checks a specific requirement or functionality.

Validation: They are employed to validate that the software meets the user's needs and expectations. 
            This involves testing against user stories or use cases.

Regression Testing: Test cases help in ensuring that new changes or features added to the software 
                    do not break existing functionality. They are rerun during regression testing to
                    verify that previously working features are still functional.

How to write Test Case:->
-------------------------
-When the customer gives the business needs then, the developer starts developing and says that they 
 need 3.5 months to build this product.
-And In the meantime, the testing team will start writing the test cases.
-Once it is done, it will send it to the Test Lead for the review process.
-And when the developers finish developing the product, it is handed over to the testing team.
-The test engineers never look at the requirement while testing the product document because testing 
 is constant and does not depends on the mood of the person rather than the quality of the test engineer.
